notes:

WALTER fonts 1-8 are not used, every font specified in the theme uses the "Volume/pan label" font.

I'm on mac and using the ClassicVGA,Medium,20 font. I think it came preinstalled with mac, if I installed it from somewhere I can't remember where. You can probably find an equivalent system font on windows to make it look similar.
